	"review": "Raising Arizona, the Coen Brothers second film overall, was their first foray into their lighthearted darkish comedy films, a complete departure from their debut film.  Starring Nicolas Cage as H.I. McDonough, an ex-con who marries and cop and steals a child, one of the Arizona Quints, thinking their parents don’t need all them children.  Raising Arizona, unlike its predecessor, provides more interesting and sympathetic characters, including the larger than life Leonard Smalls, a.k.a. The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse, who is the first of many fascinating and eccentric characters the Coen Brothers are known for.  The premise of the film is compelling, and manages to provide a crazy, yet human-filled touch of compassion and realism, something the Coen Brothers are known for.",

	"year": 1996,
	"starring": "Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare",
	"review": "Set in the Coen Brothers home state of Minnesota, Fargo tells the story of a Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who organizes a kidnap for ransom of his wife to extort money from his wealthy father-in-law, and the ensuing events that occur, which leads to police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) of Brainerd to investigate.  Arguably the best film the Coen Brothers directed, as well as the film that brought them to mainstream success, Fargo is both dark and charming at the same time.  With the Minnesota winter backdrop and Minnesota Nice providing a perfect recipe of chaos, Fargo succeeds on all fronts, with Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Gunderson providing a human touch to an otherwise dark movie.  McDormand received the Academy Award for Best Actress for this film, and Fargo won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, both of which were well deserved.  Even better was the stroke of genius decision by the Coen Brothers to introduce this film as 'This is a True Story,' which made the movie all the more riveting and controversial.  Fargo contains all the classic elements to the Coen Brothers filmography, from the eerie backdrop to the fascinating characters, making this film an easy classic.",

	"starring": "Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi",
	"review": "Set in 1991 in Los Angeles, The Big Lebowski stars Jeff Bridges as ‘The Dude,’ who becomes involved in a ransom due to mistaken identity.  A more comedic effort than the Coen Brothers other films, The Big Lebowski became a cult classic over the years in part due to its eccentric characters, crazy dream sequences and an eclectic soundtrack.  Typical of any Coen Brothers film, The Big Lebowski provides memorable characters, from the main characters to the minor, complete with quotable lines.  It’s no wonder that since 2002, an annual Lebowski Fest is held for those who cherish the film and everything it represents.  No film, in its essence, is more worthy of the term cult classic than The Big Lebowski, which wasn’t well received when it first came out, but like a great bottle of wine, or perhaps more fitting, a White Russian, has aged well over time.  The fun never ends with The Big Lebowski, full of crazy plot sequences, dream sequences and fascinating characters.",

	"title": "O Brother, Where Art Thou?",
  "image": "o-brother-where-art-thou",
	"year": 2000,
	"starring": "George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson",
	"review": "The Coen Brothers released O Brother, Where Art Thou? in 2000.  Set in 1937 in Mississippi during the Great Depression, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is based on the classic Greek poem The Odyssey, written by Homer.  The story is of three convicts who escape from prison, and their quest for treasure.  One particularly great aspect of this film is the overall feel for the era, from the dull sepia-tinted background to the extensive use of folk music.  The soundtrack, which won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002, plays a key role in the film, in particular the hit song 'I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow.'  The movie's plot provides a modern take of The Odyssey, which is by no means revolutionary, but nonetheless, fitting for the film's perceived simpler times.  The acting of the film isn't mind-blowing, but at the end of the day, the three convicts, played by Clooney, Turturro and Nelson, are likeable enough, while there are interesting minor roles, played by the likes of Coen Brothers favorite John Goodman and Stephen Root.  In all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a charming and fun ride for those willing to take it.",

	"starring": "Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Jones",
	"review": "Set in West Texas in the 1980's, No Country For Old Men, based on a novel of the same name, tells the story of hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds drug money, who's chased by sociopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), while Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the events.  Dark and thrilling, No Country For Old Men is the Coen Brother's first (and only film to date) to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.  Javier Bardem's performance of Anton Chigurh is quite stunning and chilling, making Anton Chigurh the most shocking and fascinating character to be featured in any Coen Brothers film, as he easily won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  The cat and mouse chase between Llewelyn Moss and Anton Chigurh provides most of the suspense, while Ed Tom Bell provides the compassion, giving No Country For Old Men its complexity, while the bare western backdrop makes the story eerily calm.  No Country For Old Men is another classic for the Coen Brothers, who perfectly capture the consequences of greed and violence.",

	"review": "Featuring an all-star cast, Burn After Reading is a complex tale involving political affairs, blackmail for plastic surgery and revenge.  Like many of their films, Burn After Reading contains plenty of lighthearted moments, mainly from goofy gym instructor Chad (Brad Pitt), who serves as a comic foil compared to the paranoid U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) and angry Osborne Cox (John Malkovich).  Burn After Reading doesn't quite capture the enivronment as some of their more prestigious films do, and the plot of the movie is a bit hard to follow at times, but for what it's worth, the movie as a whole is a fun experience for those who like the more lighthearted comedy thrillers.",
