	"year": 1984,
	"starring": "John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya",
	"review": "The Coen Brothers debut film came out in 1984, a tale of a bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) who hires an investigator to hill his wife and lover, only to be double crossed by his own investigator.  While the plot of the film is rather mundane and typical, the Coen Brothers introduce some of their key elements into the film, mainly their dark humor and mood-capturing visual details, along with their well timed twists.  The characters in the movie aren't particularly deep and enchanting, but nonetheless move the story along.  In all, it's a good debut for the Coen Brothers, who manage to make a simple story more suspensful, and introduce us to many of their key film stylings that further evolved for years to come.",

	"year": 1987,
	"starring": "Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter",
	"review": "Raising Arizona, the Coen Brothers second film overall, was their first foray into their lighthearted darkish comedy films, a complete departure from their debut film.  Starring Nicolas Cage as H.I. McDonough, an ex-con who marries and cop and steals a child, one of the Arizona Quints, thinking their parents don’t need all them children.  Raising Arizona, unlike its predecessor, provides more interesting and sympathetic characters, including the larger than life Leonard Smalls, a.k.a. The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse, who is the first of many fascinating and eccentric characters the Coen Brothers are known for.  The premise of the film is compelling, and manages to provide a crazy, yet human-filled touch of compassion and realism, something the Coen Brothers are known for.",

	"year": 1990,
	"starring": "Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro",
	"review": "Miller's Crossing, released in 1990, is the Coen Brothers foray into the gangster film, with the plot revolving around gangster Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), who finds himself working with and double crossing two rival gangs.  Miller's Crossing is the type of film that gracefully blows through the wind, a description clearly fitting through the references of a fedora flowing through a bed of leaves in a forest.  Like movies of its kind, Miller's Crossing is full of dramatic gangster elements, but yet the Coen Brothers make Miller's Crossing their own, using the visual feel for the film taking one back to the days of the Irish Mob of the Prohibition days to perfection.",

	"title": "Barton Fink",
  "image": "barton-fink",
	"year": 1991,
	"starring": "John Turturro, John Goodman",
	"review": "Barton Fink, released in 1991, is about a playwrite named Barton Fink (John Turturro) who heads out the Los Angeles to write a B-Movie, only to get writer’s block and wind up involved in a murder investigation. More than any other of the Coen Brothers film, Barton Fink is full of symbolism and intrigue from the main character, whose quest for filming about the common man clashes with the modern Hollywood scene, in particular with the director Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner), whose dynamic, hyper-energized role led to a nomination for best supporting actor.  Barton Fink is perhaps the Coen Brothers most complex and sympathetic character, whose frustrations and determination to reach for the common man provides a sense of gritty realism.  The plot is a bit dull at times, but fits with the rundown scenery in the film.  Barton Fink won’t blow your mind, but those seeking deeper meaning will enjoy this film.",

  "image": "fargo",
	"year": 1996,
	"starring": "Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare",
	"review": "Set in the Coen Brothers home state of Minnesota, Fargo tells the story of a Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who organizes a kidnap for ransom of his wife to extort money from his wealthy father-in-law, and the ensuing events that occur, which leads to police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) of Brainerd to investigate.  Arguably the best film the Coen Brothers directed, as well as the film that brought them to mainstream success, Fargo is both dark and charming at the same time.  With the Minnesota winter backdrop and Minnesota Nice providing a perfect recipe of chaos, Fargo succeeds on all fronts, with Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Gunderson providing a human touch to an otherwise dark movie.  McDormand received the Academy Award for Best Actress for this film, and Fargo won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, both of which were well deserved.  Even better was the stroke of genius decision by the Coen Brothers to introduce this film as 'This is a True Story,' which made the movie all the more riveting and controversial.  Fargo contains all the classic elements to the Coen Brothers filmography, from the eerie backdrop to the fascinating characters, making this film an easy classic.",

	"year": 1998,
	"starring": "Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi",
	"review": "Set in 1991 in Los Angeles, The Big Lebowski stars Jeff Bridges as ‘The Dude,’ who becomes involved in a ransom due to mistaken identity.  A more comedic effort than the Coen Brothers other films, The Big Lebowski became a cult classic over the years in part due to its eccentric characters, crazy dream sequences and an eclectic soundtrack.  Typical of any Coen Brothers film, The Big Lebowski provides memorable characters, from the main characters to the minor, complete with quotable lines.  It’s no wonder that since 2002, an annual Lebowski Fest is held for those who cherish the film and everything it represents.  No film, in its essence, is more worthy of the term cult classic than The Big Lebowski, which wasn’t well received when it first came out, but like a great bottle of wine, or perhaps more fitting, a White Russian, has aged well over time.  The fun never ends with The Big Lebowski, full of crazy plot sequences, dream sequences and fascinating characters.",

	"title": "O Brother, Where Art Thou?",
  "image": "o-brother-where-art-thou",
	"year": 2000,
	"starring": "George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson",
	"review": "The Coen Brothers released O Brother, Where Art Thou? in 2000.  Set in 1937 in Mississippi during the Great Depression, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is based on the classic Greek poem The Odyssey, written by Homer.  The story is of three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from prison, and their quest for treasure.  One particularly great aspect of this film is the overall feel for the era, from the dull sepia-tinted background to the extensive use of folk music.  The soundtrack, which won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002, plays a key role in the film, in particular the hit song 'I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow.'  The movie's plot provides a modern take of The Odyssey, which is by no means revolutionary, but nonetheless, fitting for the film's perceived simpler times.  The acting of the film isn't mind-blowing, but at the end of the day, the three convicts, played by Clooney, Turturro and Nelson, are likeable enough, while there are interesting minor roles, played by the likes of Coen Brothers favorite John Goodman and Stephen Root.  In all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a charming and fun ride for those willing to take it.",

	"review": "A remake of the 1955 British Ealing comedy film of the same name, The Ladykillers is about Ph.D Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr (Tom Hanks), who rents a room from a house of elderly widow Marva Munson (Irma Hall) to pull off a casino heist.  More of a modern version of the old classic, based in Mississippi, rather than London, The Ladykillers seems a bit odd at times.  Though Tom Hanks plays the main role quite well, he seems to be the only thing keeping the film from being a complete disaster, as the mix of characters and the overfall vibe of the film don't mix.  While it's not one of the better Coen Brothers films, it's still better than most of the garbage out these days, as Tom Hanks manages to keep the film at least somewhat interesting, especially in the beginning.",

	"year": 2007,
	"starring": "Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Jones",
	"review": "Set in West Texas in the 1980's, No Country For Old Men, based on a novel of the same name, tells the story of hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds drug money, who's chased by sociopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), while Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the events.  Dark and thrilling, No Country For Old Men is the Coen Brother's first (and only film to date) to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.  Javier Bardem's performance of Anton Chigurh is quite stunning and chilling, making Anton Chigurh the most shocking and fascinating character to be featured in any Coen Brothers film, as he easily won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  The cat and mouse chase between Llewelyn Moss and Anton Chigurh provides most of the suspense, while Ed Tom Bell provides the compassion, giving No Country For Old Men its complexity, while the bare western backdrop makes the story eerily calm.  No Country For Old Men is another classic for the Coen Brothers, who perfectly capture the consequences of greed and violence.",

	"review": "Featuring an all-star cast, Burn After Reading is a complex tale involving political affairs, blackmail for plastic surgery and revenge.  Like many of their films, Burn After Reading contains plenty of lighthearted moments, mainly from goofy gym instructor Chad (Brad Pitt), who serves as a comic foil compared to the paranoid U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) and angry Osborne Cox (John Malkovich).  Burn After Reading doesn't quite capture the enivronment as some of their more prestigious films do, and the plot of the movie is a bit hard to follow at times, but for what it's worth, the movie as a whole is a fun experience for those who like the more lighthearted comedy thrillers.",

	"review": "Set in the Coen Brothers home state of Minnesota, A Serious Man is about a Jewish teacher Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), whose life goes through a spiral after his wife asks for a get (a Jewish divorce document).  A Serious Man might lack star power, but makes up for it with gritty realism, perfectly blending religion, family and the natural elements to describe the chaos around Gopnik's life.  The opening scene telling a Yiddish folktale was the perfect metaphor to describe the film's apocalyptic vision.  The Coen Brothers effectively make an average story of a mid-life crisis and turn it upside down through a way that can be best described as poetic.",

	"review": "True Grit, a remake of the classic 1969 film of the same name starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell, tells the tale of a young girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfield) who hires U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down the man who murdered her father.  The Coen Brothers stay faithful to both the original movie and the book it’s based on, and the result is a great Western.   Steinfield, making her feature film debut as Mattie Ross, plays the part to perfection, as a young and ambitious girl looking for revenge and determined to get what she wants, while Bridges plays the gritty ruthless marshal to great results.  Not surprisingly, both received an Academy Award nomination for their roles.  True Grit is a modern take on a classic western, all while remaining true to the original.  Those who love westerns won't be disappointed.",

	"review": "Set in 1961, Inside Llewyn Davis is a film about a Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a struggling folk singer and his highs and lows trying to survive a music industry that can be cruel.  As with many of their other films, the Coen Brothers perfectly describe that cruel reality, complete with a dark and at times stormy backdrop that can only be described as poetic.  The plot at times is hit and miss, but yet the main characters plight through it all is perfectly preformed by Oscar Isaac, who not only provides a great musicality to his character, but also showcases the mix of emotions that only a folk singer could do.  Inside Llewyn Davis is the type of film that the Coen Brothers do so well, and it certainly won't disappoint those who enjoy drama pieces.",

	"review": "The Coen Brothers most recent film, Hail, Caesar!, is about a Hollywood 'fixer', Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), who has to deal with various issues involving his studio's motion pictures, primarily the kidnapping of his movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) during production of a movie entitled Hail, Caesar!  Set in the 1950's, the Coen Brothers captured the era in a visually striking way.  But the various plots within the movie make it a little hard to follow at times, and don't quite draw the viewer in as some of their other films have done.  Hail, Caesar! does a good job of representing the roaring 50's, but the Coen Brothers could have done a better job with what was a great premise.  Not the Coen Brothers best film, but it's definitely worth checking out.",
